      This project is a Visitor Recording System built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The system allows users to input visitor information such as name, age, gender, and phone number. Based on the input, the system evaluates whether the visitor is male or female, and categorizes them as either young or adult based on their age.
